The NAO Robot a wide range of applications to automate many of our daily tasks. The NAO
robot has a built-in camera that can be used to recognize faces. Our project is to use NAO
robot to take attendance for our classes. First, we will train NAO to learn the faces of
the students and save it in its memory. After the training, we will build a Blackboard
interface to take attendance using the NAO robot. This work will be based on the Python
programming language and Choregraphe software. Our application has potential
beyond the classroom. Eventually, it could be programmed to use for check-in and check-
out in hospitals, hotels, airports, work, etc.

# Weekly Progress 

# Week 1 of 01/19/20:

We are starting our project by doing research for different programs and documentation.

KRUTARTH:

• Performed some research and found some code that could be useful in making NAO to take pictures.

KRISTI:

•	Pictures can be captured by using Choregraphe as well. Here, we found that images from the code are better than the one from Choregraphe.

•	The algorithm, that is used here to take pictures from NAO robot is TakePicUsingNao.py

# Week 2

• Using face_rec.py to recognize the person in the picture taken by NAO robot

• facesrec.py can print the names of the faces. NAO has already learned the face using the "learn face " module in Choregraphe.

• Storing the data from face_rec.py to a .txt file ( Persons name and date and time of pic taken )


# Week 3

• Learn how to use the face_recognition libary in python. File face_rec.py uses mulitiple pyhton libarys do perform facial recogntition.

• Python learing on CodeAcademy

• Reaseaching of other ways to do real-time face recogtion 

# Week 4

• Learning Python File Handling: Create, Open, Append, Read, Write

•  Researching ways to do facial recognition using Amazon Rekognition and PyQt4

• Experimenting with ways to make face recognition faster and more accurate.

Plan for the upcoming week:
• Creating a website and storing the data from .txt file, which is created by NAO.

# Week 5 

• Creating a website using 000webhost

• Using  PHPMyAdmin to manage the database. 

• Making progress on the website

Plan for the upcoming week:
 • Perfecting the website to have a table of all students  and input the required data.
 
# Week 6 

•  Perfecting the website to have a form to take Course Name, First Name, Last Name 
Date and attendance.

• The website can show the attendance report of all the students

Plan for the upcoming week:

• Adding the option to take data from a .txt file and display it on the attendance report 

# Week 7 

• Added the option to take data from a .txt file and display it on the attendance report.

• Working on ways to transfer data directly from a python script to the website 

• Amazon Rekogntion will not be our choice for facial recognition 

• Still learning how PyQt4 works with python

Plan for the upcoming week:

• Planning to use Request library to post data to website directly from python 


# Week 8 

• Using requests  and beautifulsoup4 python libraries to post data to the website directly from python

• Using file testrequets.py to do the data posting to the website 
 
• Another way of doing data posting is by using mechanize pyhton libary  (mechanize.py)

Plan for the upcoming week:

• Planning to add a time option to the website. 

• Automating the python scripts to run continually  ( Take a pic ==>  recognize  student ==>  post data to the website ) 


# Week 9

Report:

• The website is taking the data from the .txt file created by NAO. The website shows which students are present and are absent.

Plan for upcoming week:
Researching of other ways to do real-time face recognition
