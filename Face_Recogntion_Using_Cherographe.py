"""
We want the robot to say name and welcome the student every time it
detects a student's face. To do this, we need to subscribe to the
HumanTracked event, raised by the ALFacedetection module, and link
it to a callback. A callback is a function that is executed every time
an event is raised. The example: run the script, and put student's face
in front of the robot : you should hear the name of student and compiler
will print the information. To begin with the algorithm, a aimple class
to get & read FaceDetected Events. The class is named as attendanceTaker,
which includes various functions like onTouched, __init___, onHumanTracked,
and run.
